## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze historical weather data to identify trends and patterns. Using this data, we build forecasting models to predict future weather conditions. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the evaluation of multiple forecasting models.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical weather data, including:
- **Date**: The date of the weather record.
- **Temperature**: Daily average temperature.
- **Precipitation**: Daily precipitation levels.
- **Humidity**: Daily average humidity.
- **Wind Speed**: Daily average wind speed.



---

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning
- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing data was addressed by either imputing values or dropping incomplete records.
- **Outlier Detection**: Outliers were identified and handled using statistical methods (e.g., Z-scores or IQR).
- **Data Normalization**: Numerical features were normalized to ensure consistency across the dataset.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Trend Analysis**: Visualized trends in temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed over time.
- **Seasonality Analysis**: Identified seasonal patterns in weather data.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Explored relationships between different weather variables using correlation matrices and heatmaps.

### Forecasting Models
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: Used for time series forecasting of temperature and precipitation.
- **Prophet**: A forecasting tool developed by Facebook for time series data with seasonality.
- **Linear Regression**: A baseline model for predicting weather variables based on historical data.
- **Random Forest Regression**: A machine learning model used for more complex predictions.

### Advanced Analyses
- **Cross-Validation**: Evaluated model performance using time-series cross-validation.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized model parameters using grid search and random search.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compared models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

## Results and Insights

- **Trends**: Identified a gradual increase in average temperature over the years, indicating potential climate change effects.
- **Seasonality**: Strong seasonal patterns were observed in temperature and precipitation.
- **Model Performance**: The ARIMA model performed best for temperature forecasting, while Prophet was more effective for precipitation predictions.
- **Key Insights**: Humidity and wind speed showed weaker correlations with temperature, suggesting they are less influential in predicting temperature trends.
